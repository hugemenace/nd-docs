# View Align

The View Align operator will create a virtual copy of the selected object with modifiers applied, allowing you to select geometry to focus the viewport camera on & look directly at. This operation will also place the 3D at the center of the selected geometry, create a custom transform orientation, and rotate the 3D cursor to align with the selected geometry's normal.
