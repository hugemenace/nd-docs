# Utils Visiblity

The Utils Visiblity operator will toggle the visibility of the special [Utils Collection](/getting-started/utils-collection) and the objects within it.

?> **Note** the viewport menu can be accessed from the main shortcut menu (SHIFT + 2 by default), or via its own dedicated keyboard shortcut **ALT + V**.
