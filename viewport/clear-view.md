# Clear View

The Clear View operator will toggle a number of viewport overlays, such as the 3D cursor, grid, floor, axis, origins etc. This mode helps remove all visual noise from the 3D viewport for when you want to inspect or admire the object you are working on.

?> **Note** the viewport menu can be accessed from the main shortcut menu (SHIFT + 2 by default), or via its own dedicated keyboard shortcut **ALT + V**.
