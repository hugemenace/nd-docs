# Cycle

The Cycle operator will cycle through all boolean utility objects affecting the currently selected object, giving you the ability to select a single or multiple utility objects at once.

It also offers an alternative "Modifier" mode which allows you to scrub through the select object's modifier stack, gradually enabling or disabling the visibility of each modifier. This mode is for visualisation purposes only and can be thought of as a "playback" device, allowing you to see the modifications affecting the object over time.
