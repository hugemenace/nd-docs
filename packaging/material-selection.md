# Material Selection

The material selection menu will allow you to quickly add an ID Material (22 hand-picked materials to choose from) to any selected object or geometry on an object. This operation is a quick and efficient way to prepare your high poly object for a material ID bake in 3rd party tools such as Marmoset Toolbag or Substance Painter.
