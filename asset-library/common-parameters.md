# Common Parameters

Many modifiers share common parameters. You can find the definition of each here.

## Context

Where applicable, the **Context** determines which portion of the input geometry the modifier will work with to produce new working geometry (output):

| Context | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Input Geometry` | The modifier uses all input geometry. |
| `Reference Geometry` | The modifier only uses the part of input geometry marked as reference. |
| `Working Geometry` | The modifier only uses the part of input geometry NOT marked as reference. |

## Next Reference

When an ND modifier has completed its work, you can optionally define what the **Next Reference** geometry will be (except for _Selectors_).

| Next Reference | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `None` | The modifier does not output any reference geometry. |
| `Input Geometry` | The modifier marks all input geometry (both working & reference) as  the new reference geometry. |
| `Working Geometry` | The modifier marks any geometry it created or modified as the new  reference geometry. |
| `Use Previous` | The modifier passes along the previous reference geometry as-is. |

?> **Note:** Reference geometry is automatically deleted after each modifier completes. However, _Use Previous_ and _Input Geometry_ preserve any existing reference geometry for later use.

## Material

Blender’s Geometry Nodes system handles materials differently from standard mesh objects. To assign a material to geometry generated by a Geometry Nodes modifier, a dedicated _Set Material_ node must normally be used. To streamline this process, ND provides a `Material` parameter that automatically applies the specified material to the output geometry created by the modifier, eliminating the need to manually add a material node in each network or stack.

## Merge Distance

When new geometry is generated, overlapping vertices can occasionally occur. To prevent these overlaps from being carried through the modifier stack, a _Merge by Distance_ node is used, controlled via the `Merge Distance` parameter.

If you’re working with small‑scale objects (for example, in the 1–100 mm range), you may need to reduce the default value to avoid unintended merging of vertices that are close but not actually overlapping.

## Preserve Context Geometry

For certain modifiers that operate directly on the input context geometry, a `Preserve Context Geometry` option is available. When enabled, this prevents the modifier from “consuming” the input geometry, allowing it to pass through unchanged instead. In most cases, consumption of the input geometry is the desired behaviour, but this toggle provides flexibility when the original geometry needs to be retained.

## Flip Normals

When faces are generated procedurally, their normals may sometimes be calculated incorrectly, causing them to face the wrong direction. Enabling this option reverses the normals, ensuring they point outward as intended.
