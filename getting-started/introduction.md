# Introduction

## Sketch

Sketching in ND is all about creating 2D planar surfaces that define the profile or cross-section of a 3D object. These surfaces are generally extruded using operators such as [Solidify](/extrusion/solidify), [Profile Extrude](/extrusion/profile-extrude), or [Screw](/extrusion/screw). They're an common starting point for non-destructive geometry.

## Modifiers

Modifiers are the fundamental building block of a non-destructive workflow. They define the transformation pipeline, converting simple 3D geometry into more defined and complex 3D geometry.

ND utilises Blender's built-in modifiers through interactive overlays, simplifying complicated or otherwise tedious modelling tasks while keeping all of your actions non-destructive.

## Generators

Generators are tools which use pre-defined modifier stacks or asset packs to create common shapes and geometry.

## Utils

ND contains several utilities which simplify complicated or tedious tasks, both destructive and non-destructive.
