# Geo Lift

The Geo Lift operator allows you to select and duplicate otherwise impossible to select vertices, edges, or faces from non-destructive geometry with ease. It's a great way to start a new sketch as well.

!> **Note:** unlike most other operators you'll need to hit the spacebar to confirm your selection. This was implemented as you need to be able to use the left mouse button to select geometry, instead of confirming the operation.

## Options
