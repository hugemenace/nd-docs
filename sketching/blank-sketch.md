# Blank Sketch

The Blank Sketch operator allows you to quickly start with a single vertex and perform a number of extrusions on it to define your 2D shape. When committing the sketch, the resulting geometry will be a single face with all overlapping edges and vertices removed.

?> **Tip:** this operator is a good candidate for using the pause functionality of ND while sketching. Once committed, you can use the solidify operator to convert the sketch into a solid 3D shape.
