# Difference Boolean

The Difference Boolean operator will combine the select objects in a subtractive way.

?> **Note:** the order of selection matters for booleans. Start by selecting the utility/reference geometry, **then** the geometry to be affected.

## Alternative modes

Hold down the shortcut when selecting the operator to enter the respective mode.

| Shortcut | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`SHIFT`** | Protect the reference object (do not convert to utility) |
| **`ALT`** | Do not clean the reference object's mesh. By default ND removes (cleans) problematic modifiers from the reference object, such as Triangulate |
