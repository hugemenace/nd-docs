# Square Array [R]

!> **Deprecated**: This operator has been replaced by the [Array Cubed](/power-mods/array-cubed) operator. Square Array will eventually be completely removed from the addon. If you would like to utilise it for the short term, it can be re-enabled in the latest release by turning on "Compatibility Mode" in the addon preferences.

The Square Array operator allows you to array an object in a square/grid like fashion.
