# Booleans

There are 4 primary types of boolean operations that ND can automate: **Difference**, **Intersection**, **Union**, and **Slice**.

!> In order to make use of this operator, first select the reference (cutting) object and then the target object. The target object will be one with the boolean modifier applied to it.

?> **Note:** this operator will set the reference object's viewport display to wireframe, hide the object in renders, parent it to the target object, and prefix its name with "Bool â€” ". Future versions of the operator will automatically place the reference object in a seperate collection for easier management.
