# Booleans

There are 3 primary types of boolean operations (with more to come) that ND can automate on objects: **Difference**, **Intersection**, and **Union**.

!> In order to make use of this operator, first select the reference (cutting) object and then the target object. The target (active) object will be one with the boolean modifier applied to it.

?> **Note:** this operator will set the reference (cutting) object's viewport display to wireframe, as well as disable/hide the object in renders. Future versions of the operator will automatically place the reference objects in a seperate collection for easier management.
