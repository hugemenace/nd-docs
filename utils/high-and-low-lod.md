# High & Low LOD

The High & Low LOD operator will suffix objects and their corresponding mesh names with `_high` and `_low` respectively.

For example, take this object named `Enigma`:

![High & Low LOD Before](../_media/high-and-low-lod-before-out.jpg)

After selecting the object and running the High LOD operator, the object and mesh names will be suffixed with `_high`:

![High & Low LOD After](../_media/high-and-low-lod-after-out.jpg)

?> **Tip:** this operator is useful when creating a high and low poly version of your model for baking in software such as Marmoset Toolbag & Substance Painter.
