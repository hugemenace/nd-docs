# Smart Duplicate

Behaves identically to Blender's default duplicate mechanism (SHIFT + D), except that Smart Duplicate will also duplicate the object's associated utility objects (boolean references, empties) ensuring it continues to operate and behave as expected.

## Alternative modes

Hold down the shortcut when selecting the operator to enter the respective mode.
