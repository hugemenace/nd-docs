# Name & Data Sync

The Name & Data Sync operator allows you to synchronize the mesh/data names of objects in your scene with their overarching object names.

Example, Here is an object `Enigma` who's mesh is named `Cube.001`:

![Name & Data Sync Before](../_media/name-and-data-sync-before-out.jpg)

After selecting the object and running the Name & Data Sync operator, the mesh name will be changed to `Enigma`:

![Name & Data Sync After](../_media/name-and-data-sync-after-out.jpg)

?> **Tip:** this operator is useful for keeping your scene organized and keeping your mesh names consistent.
