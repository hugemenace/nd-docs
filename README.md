# Welcome

ND (short for non-destructive) is a Blender addon that provides a number of workflow enhancements, tools, operations, and generators â€” tailored specifically for non-destructive modelling. 

This approach is useful for many types of modelling needs, particularly hard-surface forms, while being able to quickly adjust parameters without the need for manual poly-modelling. ND makes extensive use of modifiers to enable this flexible workflow.
